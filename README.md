# GO-Movie-CRUD

A simple Go-based RESTful API designed for managing movies with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project is an ideal starting point for developers learning Go and RESTful APIs. It demonstrates clean coding practices and uses the popular `Gorilla Mux` router for efficient routing.

This API can be used for educational purposes or as a foundation for more complex projects such as movie recommendation systems or inventory management.
